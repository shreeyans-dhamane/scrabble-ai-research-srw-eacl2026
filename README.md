This project presents a novel approach to optimizing decision-making in stochastic, incomplete-information, tile-based word games. We formalize the game as a Markov Decision Process and propose a heuristic-driven AI agent, the RiskAwareAgent. This agent evaluates all possible moves by calculating their true score and all potential future moves by their expected value. The probability of achieving a future move is derived from the multivariate hypergeometric distribution, which models the "sampling without replacement" nature of drawing tiles.

The agent's decision to play or gamble is governed by a tunable hyperparameter. We compare this agent against a baseline GreedyAgent that always selects the highest-scoring immediate move. This repository provides the simulation environment and experimentation scripts to replicate the paper's findings, demonstrating that an optimally tuned agent achieves a superior win rate over the greedy baseline.
